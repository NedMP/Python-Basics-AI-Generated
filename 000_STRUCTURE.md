# Python Notes Documentation Style Guide

This guide defines the layout, tone, structure, and complexity standards for all Markdown documentation created within the `Python_Notes` directory. All future documents should follow this format to maintain consistency, clarity, and usability.

---

## 1. Purpose
Each document must serve as a **practical reference** for users who are learning, refreshing, or implementing Python and related tooling. Assume readers are technically capable but may be returning to the language after time away. Prioritize clarity and direct applicability.

---

## 2. Layout and Structure

Each document should follow this core structure:

1. **Title Header**  
   Use a single `#` heading with a concise description, e.g.:
   ```md
   # Python + venv on macOS (Homebrew) — updated Oct 5, 2025
   ```
   Include a last updated date.

2. **Introduction**  
   - Provide a one-paragraph overview of what the document covers and why it’s relevant.  
   - Keep language beginner-friendly but not verbose.  
   - If the process assumes specific tools or OS (e.g., macOS, zsh), state this upfront.

3. **Quick Summary / Context Note (Optional)**  
   - Include short clarifying notes at the top such as command conventions, e.g.:
     ```md
     **Note on Terminal Conventions:**
     Commands prefixed with `$` represent user input; unprefixed lines represent output.
     ```

4. **Table of Contents (TOC)**  
   - Always provide a TOC for documents longer than five sections.  
   - Use Markdown anchors with clear numbering (e.g., `[1) Install Python](#1-install-python)`).

5. **Sequential Numbered Sections**  
   Each topic or step should be its own numbered section (`## 0`, `## 1`, etc.).  
   Every section should include:
   - **Header:** concise and action-oriented.  
   - **Explanation:** 2–5 sentences describing *what* this step does and *why* it matters.  
   - **Command Example(s):** shown in fenced code blocks.  
   - **Expected Output or Result:** optional but encouraged for clarity.  
   - **Notes or Tips:** for context, troubleshooting, or best practices.

   Example:
   ```md
   ## 3) Create and activate a virtual environment

   Virtual environments isolate Python packages so different projects don’t interfere with each other.

   ```sh
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

   The prompt should now display `(.venv)`.
   ```

6. **Explanation Blocks**  
   Use short paragraphs between code examples to describe what’s happening. Avoid leaving commands unexplained.

7. **Optional Sections**  
   - **“Common Issues”** or **“Troubleshooting”** section for recurring problems.  
   - **“Testing the Setup”** to confirm successful configuration.

8. **Recap / Flow Diagram (Optional)**  
   Summarize the workflow visually using a plain-text flow chart:
   ```plaintext
   Install Tool → Configure Environment → Test Setup → Troubleshoot → Expand with Tools
   ```

9. **Modern Tools and Alternatives**  
   Include a final section (e.g., `## 12) Modern Tooling`) highlighting newer or advanced tools related to the topic. Mention which are optional and when to use them.

---

## 3. Formatting Rules

- Use **bold** for important terms, **italics** for emphasis.  
- Avoid bullet lists longer than five items; prefer numbered lists for step-by-step guidance.  
- Use fenced code blocks with language identifiers (`sh`, `python`, `toml`, etc.).  
- Keep command examples exact and copy-paste-ready.  
- When showing expected output, use indented code blocks or fenced blocks without a language identifier.

Example:
```sh
python app.py
```
Expected output:
```
Hello, Ned!
```

---

## 4. Complexity and Tone

- **Audience:** Intermediate or returning developers; minimal prior setup knowledge assumed.  
- **Tone:** Direct, instructional, neutral. Avoid filler or opinion.  
- **Length:** Each section should be self-contained and scannable (no section longer than ~15 lines of explanation).  
- **Voice:** Second person (“you”) is acceptable; avoid passive constructions.  
- **Goal:** Ensure readers understand both *how* and *why* each command or configuration works.

---

## 5. Example Layout Template

Use the following structure when creating a new Markdown note:

```md
# [Document Title] — updated [Date]

Intro paragraph (what this covers and why it matters)

---

**Note:** Any special assumptions (e.g., OS, shell, tools)

---

## 0) [First Section]
Explanation of purpose.

```sh
# Example commands
```
Expected output or effect (optional)

---

## 1) [Next Section]
Description + rationale.

...repeat pattern...

---

## N) Modern Tooling and Next Steps
Optional advanced topics or alternatives.

---

### Recap Flow
```plaintext
Step 1 → Step 2 → Step 3 → Done
```
```

---

## 6. Examples and Consistency
- Match tone and structure used in `SETUP.md`.  
- Each document must stand alone; don’t assume the reader has seen others.  
- When referencing another file (e.g., `SETUP.md`), link clearly and specify what’s covered there.  
- Use consistent section numbering and Markdown formatting across all documents.

---

## 7. Validation Checklist for New Documents
Before finalizing any new Markdown file:
- [ ] Title includes topic and date.
- [ ] Intro explains purpose and assumptions.
- [ ] Table of Contents included if >5 sections.
- [ ] Each section explains *why* before showing *how*.
- [ ] Commands are tested and copy-paste safe.
- [ ] Flow diagram or recap provided.
- [ ] Tone matches `SETUP.md` (clear, neutral, no fluff).
- [ ] Document reviewed for accuracy and consistency.

Following this structure ensures every note is easy to navigate, technically accurate, and consistent with the original `SETUP.md` standard.
