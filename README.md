## üß≠ Project Overview
This repository is a **comprehensive Python reference and learning series** designed for:
- **IT administrators and automation engineers** working with macOS, Windows, and cloud environments.
- **Sysadmins and support specialists** who want practical, reusable Python scripts.
- **Learners returning to Python**, needing a structured, modern roadmap covering environment setup through automation, APIs, and cloud scripting.

Each numbered file is a self-contained guide covering one Python topic, written to be clear, modern, and immediately useful for real-world automation.

## üß† How to Use This Repository
1. Start with **002_SETUP.md** to configure Python and environment management.  
2. Progress sequentially through **003‚Äì010** for language fundamentals.  
3. From **011+**, topics become specialized (automation, APIs, cloud).  
4. Each document is standalone but follows a consistent pattern for easy cross‚Äëreference.

---

## üîß Future Plans
- Add automated testing for all code samples (pytest) and run them in CI.
- Provide a script index and runnable snippets in a `scripts/` directory.
- Cross‚Äëlink related guides and add a searchable index.

## üìù Prompt Template for Adding or Updating Guides

Use this prompt to create or revise any single guide while preserving the style rules in `000_STRUCTURE.md` and using `002_SETUP.md` for reference.

```text
!!IMPORTANT!! ONLY update <TARGET_FILENAME>! 000_STRUCTURE.md is to be treated as instructions. 002_SETUP.md can be used as additional reference:

<TARGET_FILENAME> overview - <one-line purpose of the guide>
```

**How to use**
- Replace `<TARGET_FILENAME>` with the exact Markdown filename, e.g., `045_EXAMPLE_TOPIC.md`.
- Replace the overview line with a concise, single‚Äësentence description of the guide‚Äôs scope and goals.
- Keep the rest of the repository unchanged. The assistant should only modify the specified file.
- Follow the layout, tone, and numbering rules from `000_STRUCTURE.md`.
