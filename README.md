## üß≠ Project Overview
This repository is a **comprehensive Python reference and learning series** designed for:
- **IT administrators and automation engineers** working with macOS, Windows, and cloud environments.
- **Sysadmins and support specialists** who want practical, reusable Python scripts.
- **Learners returning to Python**, needing a structured, modern roadmap covering environment setup through automation, APIs, and cloud scripting.

Each numbered file is a self-contained guide covering one Python topic, written to be clear, modern, and immediately useful for real-world automation.

## üß† How to Use This Repository
1. Start with **002_SETUP.md** to configure Python and environment management.  
2. Progress sequentially through **003‚Äì010** for language fundamentals.  
3. From **011+**, topics become specialized (automation, APIs, cloud).  
4. Each document is standalone but follows a consistent pattern for easy cross‚Äëreference.

---

## üîß Future Plans
- Add completed sections 021‚Äì044 progressively with peer review.  
- Introduce automated testing for all code samples.  
- Provide a script index and runnable snippets in a `scripts/` directory.
